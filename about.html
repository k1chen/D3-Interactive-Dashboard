      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        Use your mouse to brush over the scatter plot to update the pie chart
        and the stacked bar chart below it. By brushing the main chart, the data
        from the selected families will update accordingly. Furthermore, use the
        dropdown menu to view data from either 2021 or 2022.
        <strong>Note:</strong> You may need to switch between the years a couple
        times before the data actually updates, I wasn’t sure why this was the
        case but I hope this is not that significant of an issue.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        For the Interactive Dashboard using D3 visualization project, I chose to
        re-explore the EdConnect Household Survey to investigate the
        relationship between enrollment status in the district-wide EdConnect
        broadband initiative program and the race of the households.

      <h2>Process of Building Charts</h2>
      <p>
        The main chart, the scatterplot, is simply a visualization of every
        single family that responded to the survey within a specific year
        (either 2021 or 2022). It took a lot of time to figure out how I would
        portray this data, as the X and Y axes were impossible to define given
        that there were no numerical parameters for the families outside of
        their ID. In order to map this, I created 2 new columns in the dataset
        called “rowNum” and “colNum,” which essentially assigned a unique number
        to each family within the dataset. This way, I could plot the families
        based on these two identification numbers and the users would be able to
        see every single family on a single chart and brush over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stacked bar chart was inspired by my previous project, where I used
        stacked bar charts to show the difference between BIPOC/All White family
        selections for a different question. This time, the question was the
        enrollment status of the family in the EdConnect broadband program, and
        the stacked bars allowed for a visualization of the difference between
        BIPOC and all White families’ enrollment statuses. Based on the user’s
        brushing of the scatterplot, the bar chart would adapt to the
        brushed-upon data points. Furthermore, the scale would adapt based on
        how many families the user may have brushed over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pie chart represents the split between BIPOC and all-White families,
        where it does the same function as the bar chart to adapt to the brushed
        data points from the scatterplot depending on the user. Furthermore, if
        the user hovers over either part of the pie chart, a tooltip will appear
        that displays the count of either BIPOC or All White, depending on which
        section is being hovered over.
      </p>

      <h2>Note</h2>
      <p>
        An interesting caveat, as I also pointed out in the last project, was
        that there were some families in the dataset that didn’t have any data
        for whether or not they were BIPOC or all-White. I wasn’t sure what to
        do with this, but I noticed that the dashboard created by David Shen
        that was in the instructions of the dataset seemed to have added these
        unidentified families into the all-White total. I felt that his method
        was a dishonest portrayal of the data since it skews in a certain
        pattern that may not be true, so I just did not incorporate unidentified
        families in the charts to preserve its integrity.
